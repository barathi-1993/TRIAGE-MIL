## 📌 Overview

**TRIAGE-MIL** is a two-stage weakly supervised framework for survival prediction from whole-slide images (WSIs).

Whole-slide images contain tens of thousands of tiles, but only a subset may carry prognostic information. Standard MIL models often treat tiles as unordered independent instances, while graph-based MIL models are usually limited to pairwise relationships. TRIAGE-MIL addresses these limitations by selecting prognostically informative tiles and modeling higher-order tissue relationships through semantic hypergraphs.

TRIAGE-MIL combines three key components:

1. **MASS: Multi-Axis Stratified Sampling**  
   An unsupervised tile selection strategy that selects a fixed-size subset of informative tiles.

2. **Semantic hierarchical hypergraph modeling**  
   A higher-order relational module that captures intra- and inter-tissue relationships beyond pairwise graph edges.

3. **Gated-attention MIL survival prediction**  
   A patient-level survival prediction module trained using Cox partial likelihood.

---

## 🧬 Framework

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/TRIAGE_MIL_framework.png" width="850">
</p>

TRIAGE-MIL consists of the following pipeline:

1. **WSI preprocessing using CLAM**
   - Tissue masking
   - Tile extraction
   - Coordinate generation

2. **Feature extraction using UNI**
   - Non-overlapping **256 × 256** tiles are extracted at **20× magnification**.
   - Tile-level features are encoded using the **UNI pathology foundation model**.
   - Each tile is represented by a **1024-dimensional embedding**.

3. **Feature quality filtering**
   - Low-quality or uninformative tile embeddings are removed using statistical criteria.

4. **MASS tile selection**
   - A fixed budget of **K = 4096** tiles is selected per WSI.
   - Selection is performed using four phenotype-inspired axes.

5. **Semantic hierarchical hypergraph construction**
   - Selected tiles are grouped into semantic super-nodes.
   - Hyperedges model containment, intra-semantic similarity, and inter-semantic interactions.

6. **Survival prediction**
   - Final tile representations are aggregated using gated attention pooling.
   - A patient-level risk score is predicted using Cox survival loss.

---

## 🔎 MASS: Multi-Axis Stratified Sampling

**MASS** reduces a large WSI tile bag into a compact, informative subset.

Given tile embeddings from a WSI, MASS first applies feature-space quality filtering and then selects tiles using four phenotype-inspired axes:

| Axis | Description |
|---|---|
| **Morphologic Heterogeneity (MH)** | Selects tiles with high morphologic variability using feature variance. |
| **Tissue Regularity (TR)** | Selects structured or regular tissue patterns using feature magnitude-to-variance ratio. |
| **Microenvironmental Interface (MI)** | Selects spatial neighborhoods with high local variation, capturing interface-like regions. |
| **Tissue Diversity (TD)** | Selects rare or underrepresented morphologies using farthest-point sampling in feature space. |

The selected tile subset is assigned semantic labels corresponding to these four axes. These semantic labels are later used for semantic hypergraph construction.

---

## 🌐 Semantic Hierarchical Hypergraph

TRIAGE-MIL represents selected tiles as a semantic hierarchical hypergraph.

The hypergraph contains:

- **Tile nodes**
- **Semantic super-nodes**
- **Containment hyperedges**
- **Intra-semantic hyperedges**
- **Inter-semantic hyperedges**

This design allows TRIAGE-MIL to model higher-order tissue organization, including relationships among tumor-associated regions, stromal structures, tissue interfaces, and morphologically diverse regions.

## 🧾 Data Preparation

### WSI Preprocessing

WSIs are processed using the **CLAM preprocessing pipeline**.

In the manuscript, WSIs were:

- processed at **20× magnification**
- tiled into **non-overlapping 256 × 256 patches**
- encoded using the **UNI foundation model**
- represented as **1024-dimensional tile embeddings**

Expected feature organization:

```text
data/features/
└── UNI/
    └── pt_files/
        ├── patient_001.pt
        ├── patient_002.pt
        ├── patient_003.pt
        └── ...
```

Each `.pt` file should contain:

```python
{
    "features": Tensor[N, D],
    "coords": Tensor[N, 2]
}
```

where:

- `N` is the number of tiles in the WSI
- `D` is the UNI feature dimension
- `coords` stores tile coordinates

---

## 📄 Label File Format

The survival label CSV should contain:

```text
patient_id,survival_time,survival_event
```

Example:

```text
patient_id,survival_time,survival_event
P001,42.5,1
P002,60.0,0
P003,18.2,1
```

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `patient_id` | Patient or WSI identifier matching the `.pt` filename |
| `survival_time` | Follow-up or survival time |
| `survival_event` | Event indicator, where `1 = event/death` and `0 = censored` |

## 🚀 Step 1: MASS Top-k Tile Selection

Run MASS tile selection on CLAM-style UNI feature files:

```bash
python src/mass_selector.py \
  --feature-root ./data/features \
  --encoder UNI/pt_files \
  --out-cache-best ./cache/MASS_TOPK_TILES/CLAM_UNI \
  --format-type clam \
  --gpus "0" \
  --n-workers 1 \
  --topk 4096 \
  --min-axis-frac 0.05 \
  --diversity-mode kcenter \
  --save-artifacts \
  --tile-dir ./data/tiles \
  --skip-optuna
```

Expected output:

```text
cache/MASS_TOPK_TILES/CLAM_UNI/
├── patient_001_topk_idx.npy
├── patient_001_topk_labels.npy
├── patient_001_topk_risks.npy
├── patient_002_topk_idx.npy
├── patient_002_topk_labels.npy
├── patient_002_topk_risks.npy
└── ...
```

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Precompute Semantic Hierarchical Hypergraphs

After MASS tile selection, precompute patient-level semantic hypergraphs:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python src/precompute_hypergraphs.py \
  --config configs/config_TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI_5fold.json \
  --gpu 0
```

Expected output:

```text
cache/MASS_TOPK_TILES/CLAM_UNI/hypergraphs/
├── patient_001_H_k10_i5_t12.pt
├── patient_002_H_k10_i5_t12.pt
└── ...
```

Each hypergraph file contains:

- sparse hypergraph incidence matrix
- tile-to-super-node assignment
- semantic super-node labels
- metadata

---

## 🏋️ Step 3: Train TRIAGE-MIL

Train a single fold:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python src/train_triage_mil.py \
  --config configs/config_TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI_5fold.json \
  --fold 0
```

Train five folds on separate GPUs:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python src/train_triage_mil.py --config configs/config_TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI_5fold.json --fold 0 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python src/train_triage_mil.py --config configs/config_TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI_5fold.json --fold 1 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python src/train_triage_mil.py --config configs/config_TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI_5fold.json --fold 2 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 python src/train_triage_mil.py --config configs/config_TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI_5fold.json --fold 3 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4 python src/train_triage_mil.py --config configs/config_TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI_5fold.json --fold 4 &
```

Resume interrupted training:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 AUTO_RESUME=true python src/train_triage_mil.py \
  --config configs/config_TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI_5fold.json \
  --fold 0
```

---

## 📈 Step 4: Kaplan–Meier and Log-rank Analysis

After training, generate Kaplan–Meier curves and log-rank statistics:

```bash
python src/km_analysis.py \
  --predictions_dir ./results/TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI \
  --output_dir ./results/TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI/km_results \
  --method median
```

Expected outputs:

```text
results/TRIAGE_MIL_CLAM_UNI/km_results/
├── fold_0_km_curves.png
├── fold_1_km_curves.png
├── fold_2_km_curves.png
├── fold_3_km_curves.png
├── fold_4_km_curves.png
└── km_summary.csv
```

## 🗂️ Datasets

TRIAGE-MIL was evaluated on six cancer cohorts:

| Cohort | Number of Cases |
|---|---:|
| In-House CRC | 790 |
| TCGA-LUAD | 565 |
| TCGA-STAD | 382 |
| TCGA-BLCA | 365 |
| TCGA-BRCA | 385 |
| TCGA-CRC / COAD-READ | 1008 |

---

## 🏆 Results

TRIAGE-MIL was compared against 13 state-of-the-art MIL and survival prediction baselines:

- Max-Pooling
- Mean-Pooling
- ABMIL
- CLAM
- TransMIL
- DSMIL
- DTFD-MIL
- MambaMIL
- DeepAttnMISL
- OTSurv
- IB-MIL
- ILRA
- PANTHER

### C-index Performance

| Model | In-House CRC | LUAD | STAD | BLCA | BRCA | TCGA-CRC | Mean |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| OTSurv | 0.695±0.028 | 0.663±0.074 | 0.630±0.027 | 0.618±0.026 | 0.643±0.026 | 0.665±0.050 | 0.652±0.028 |
| TRIAGE-MIL | **0.712±0.035** | **0.687±0.061** | **0.676±0.013** | **0.651±0.038** | **0.668±0.021** | **0.714±0.062** | **0.685±0.025** |

TRIAGE-MIL achieved the best mean C-index of **0.685**, improving over the strongest baseline, OTSurv, by **3.3 percentage points**.

Kaplan–Meier analysis showed significant risk-group separation across all six cohorts using median predicted risk for stratification.

---

## 🔬 Ablation Study

| Method | Mean C-index |
|---|---:|
| TRIAGE-MIL Final | **0.685±0.025** |
| w/o Quality-Aware Filtering | 0.676±0.026 |
| w/o MASS | 0.665±0.026 |
| w/o Semantic Labels | 0.672±0.026 |
| w/o Relational Modeling | 0.660±0.027 |
| w/o Hierarchical Super-nodes | 0.671±0.025 |

The largest performance drop occurs when relational modeling is removed, supporting the importance of hypergraph-based higher-order tissue relationship modeling.

---

## 🎯 Interpretability

TRIAGE-MIL provides tile-level attention maps over the MASS-selected tiles.

Because inference is performed only on the selected subset of **K = 4096** tiles, attention maps appear as sparse tile-level visualizations rather than dense pixel-level heatmaps.

The interpretability pipeline includes:

- tissue-type context maps
- TRIAGE-MIL attention maps
- MASS semantic category overlays
- representative top-attention tiles
- Kaplan–Meier risk-group visualization
